This study aims to emphasize the importance of historical land cover maps and introduce a new benchmark dataset derived from very high-resolution historical Hexagon (KH-9) reconnaissance satellite images for use in deep learning-based image segmentation tasks. Our HexaLCSeg dataset comprises high-resolution monochromatic Hexagon images from the 1970s and 1980s covering Turkish and Bulgarian territories, encompassing a large geographic area

The dataset, related source code, and pre-trained models are available below.
