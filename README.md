This repository contains weights for YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLOv9 networks trained with the VHRTrees dataset. YOLOv5 [(link)](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and YOLOv8 [(link)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) were built and trained by our team using Ultralytics library, while YOLOv7 training has been performed using the YOLOv7 repository [(link)](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7). YOLOv9 training has also been performed using the YOLOv9 repository [(link)](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9).

The [(dataset)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), related source code, and [(pre-trained models)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) are available below.
